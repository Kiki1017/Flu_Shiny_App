## R Shiny Application for Weekly Influenza Data

The Cook County Department of Public Health collects and analyzes data on local influenza activity year-round. During periods when higher influenza activity is expected (from MMWR Week 40 through MMWR Week 20), this information is compiled into a weekly surveillance report that is distributed to our partners in the healthcare community, schools, community groups, and the public. This application was created as a companion to our weekly surveillance report to give users greater access to the data.

Data sources include:
- emergency room activity from CCDPH's syndromic surveillance system: ESSENCE,
- laboratory testing by local sentinel laboratories and CDC's ILINet sentinel laboratories,
- mandatory reporting of flu-associated intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations, and,
- mortality data from the Illinois Vital Records System.

Data is not included in the repository; however, visitors are welcome to view and borrow code.

The application is live [here](https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/weekly_influenza_surveillance_beta/), but still under development so errors/inefficiencies might be noted. Feedback to improve the code is welcome.
